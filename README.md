# DIGIWave
DIGIWave is a (currently) small utility for processing I/Q dumps from an SDR.

I implemented it to decode FSK manchester encoded data from a transponder.

At the moment, DIGIWave can perform pulse-width detection/triggering via an RMS threshold.

Currently planned features include:
* Filter chains
* Manchester Decoding
* Any other signal processing that comes up or is needed.

Apologies for the dragons, this source hasn't been cleaned for public consumption yet.
